## 🎯 What it does

It checks if your password is strong enough to fight off hackers, bots, and your little cousin who guesses your password is your crush's name.

Criteria:
- ✅ At least 8 characters
- ✅ 1 uppercase letter
- ✅ 1 lowercase letter
- ✅ 1 digit
- ✅ 1 special character (yes, `!@#%$^` is love)
- ✅ No spaces, we're not writing poems
